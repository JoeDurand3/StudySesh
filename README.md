# StudySesh
An experiment in Xamarin cross-platform app development

## What is StudySesh?
StudySesh hopes to connect classmates and other students together to tackle the latest homework assignment, upcoming midterm, or anything else worth studying. Users will be able to simply set up a Study Sesh - in their apartment complex, favorite coffee shop, or library corner - and allow other people to meet up and get stuff done.

##In Development
StudySesh has not yet reached it's first fully functional iteration - feel free to contribute!
